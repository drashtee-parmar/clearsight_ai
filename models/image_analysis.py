    Analyze the provided image for accessibility.
    Consider the following:
    1. Does the image convey important information that needs to be described?
    2. Is the existing alt text sufficient, descriptive, and concise?
    3. Are there any potential compliance issues (e.g., text in image that isn't replicated, complex charts needing detailed descriptions)?
    4. Is the image purely decorative? If so, suggest an empty alt text or indicate it's decorative.
    5. Check for any PII or sensitive information visible in the image.

    Existing Alt Text: "{existing_alt_text}"

    Based on your analysis, provide:
    - `is_decorative` (boolean): True if purely decorative, False otherwise.
    - `current_alt_text_sufficiency` (string): "Good", "Needs Improvement", "Missing".
    - `suggested_alt_text` (string): A concise and descriptive alt text. If decorative, suggest "".
    - `compliance_issues` (list of strings): List of identified WCAG 2.2 AA issues related to the image.
    - `pii_risk` (boolean): True if potential PII is detected, False otherwise.
    - `explanation` (string): A brief explanation of the findings.
